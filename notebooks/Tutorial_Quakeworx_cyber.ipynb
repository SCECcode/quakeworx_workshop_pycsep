    "In this tutorial, we show how use the PyCSEP package to load and evaluate catalog-based forecasts generated using the UCERF3-ETAS model. The procedure is general and can be applied to any other forecasting model producing catalog-based forecasts in the same format. The aim of this tutorial is to illustrate how to produce maps of expected sesmic activity along with observations at different time scales, and to familiarise the user with computing and interpreting CSEP tests results. In doing this, we focus on the difference between grid-based forecasts and catalog-based forecasts, showing that the latter provides more information and more trustworthy results.\n",

This produce a number (the value of the statistic) for each synthetic catalog, we refer to this set of values as the test distribution. This is because these values are used to estimate the distribution of the statistic under the model. For example, for the N-test, we use the number of events per catalog to estimate the distribution of the number of events under (provided by) the forecast.

We can find and plot the synthetic catalog with the maximum number of events. The list of synethtic catalogs in $\\texttt{csep.core.catalogs.CSEPCatalog()}$ format can be accessed with the command $\\texttt{[forecast].catalogs}$. We can see that the synthetic catalog has 184 events with maximum magnitude around $7.7$, the figure shows that the synthetic catalog is strongly clustered around the faults which highlights the spatial features of the UCERF3-ETAS model.

The probability that a synthetic catalog has a statistic lower than the observed one is $0.7$, however we can see that this value is strongly influenced by the spike around -10. The strange shape of the distribution is mostly due to the fact that more than $75\\%$ of the synthetic catalogs have zero events and provide no information on the spatial distribution.

    "# Forecast for the day after El-Mayor Cucapah\n",
    "Below we repeat the analysis for the day after El-Mayor Cucapah $7.2$ $M_w$ earthquake, namely the 5, April 2010. This day is interesting because has more events (30 3.95+ $M_w$) compared to the 04/04/2010 which provides a useful scenario to interpret the CSEP test results more closely. Also, the forecast now takes into account that a large event just occurred and we can see the different parts of the UCERF3-ETAS model that are activated. We start by plotting the spatial and magnitude distribution of the forecast. The most interesting of the two is the magnitude distribution which is clearly different from the one provided by the forecast for the day before. This is because UCERF3-ETAS incorporates hypothesis on the recurrence of large events, and the probability of large magnitude events is reduced after one. "

The difference is due to the different parts of the UCERF3-ETAS which are activated.

Contrarily, in the case of the 5 April, 2010 the aftershock part of the model is active which does not account for faults. "

In this case, we see that synthetic catalogs often have higher values of the S-test statistics than the observed one ($94\\%$ of the cases). This indicates that the synthetic catalogs are too clustered with respect the observations. This is because they present higher log-likelihoods, which means that they tend to be more clustered in the bright area of the map than the observations. If it was the opposite situation, the bulk of the test distribution is on the left side of the observed statistic, we would have the opposite situation, that the forecast is too smooth. Similarly, this is due to the fact that the observations tend to cluster more closely in a high likelihood region than the synthetic catalogs. "
